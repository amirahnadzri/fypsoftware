    The title of our project is called Smartphone-Based Food Assessment Using Semantic Ontology and Deep Learning.

<h2>Reason for Project</h2>

The reason we started this project was because we too are a part of the group with dietary restrictions.
  
> Due to religious dietary restrictions, we are not permitted to consume pork, alcohol and non-halal meat. As muslim students who are studying in a foreign country where muslims are considered a minority, it is hard for us to easily find food products that are permissible for us to consume.
  
In early discussion, we realized how determining whether a product is halal or not by its list of ingredients specifically meat-based products are not 100% accurate as halal meat are usually stamped with a halal certified logo and not mentioned in the list of ingredients. Therefore, we decided to not include religious dietary restrictions. We chose to cater to dietary restrictions such as veganism, lactose intolerance, egg intolerance, pescatarianism, pollotarianism and lacto-ovo vegetarianism as we are also able to consume food products that are within these groups' dietary restrictions.
