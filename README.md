    The title of our project is called Smartphone-Based Food Assessment Using Semantic Ontology and Deep Learning.
  
 In this project, we created a mobile application called **Food4U** which will provide a service for users specifically of those who are a part of a group with dietary restrictions or have personal food preferences such as vegans, pescatarians, lacto-ovo vegetarians, etc.

<h2>Reason for Project</h2>

The reason we started this project was because we too are a part of the group with dietary restrictions.
  
> Due to lactoce intolerance, it is difficult for us to purchase products that are suitable for our diet and for us to consume.
  
We also chose to cater to dietary restrictions such as veganism, egg intolerance, pescatarianism, pollotarianism and lacto-ovo vegetarianism on top of lactose intolerance in our project to broaden the choices for dietary restrictions in our application.
